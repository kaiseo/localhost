## 🏗️ The Vision: Beyond a Cabin

Localhost is not just a community; it's an **Infrastructure Project**. We are building both the digital and physical foundations where nomads, developers, and builders can truly belong. Our mission is to solve the isolation of digital life by constructing a real-world village ecosystem.

### Key Pillars:
- **🛠️ Nomad Infrastructure**: Building the OS and services that power a nomad's life.
- **🏡 Village Construction**: Real-world development of a nomad hub in Jeungpyeong.
- **🔕 Focus-First Environment**: A space where you can turn off the noise and focus on the essence.
- **🤝 Deep Connection**: Moving beyond shallow networking to real peer-to-peer building.

## ✨ Features

- **Premium Immersive UI**: Cinematic noise textures, mouse-following spotlights, and multi-layer parallax depth.
- **Atmospheric Experience**: Integrated ASMR (campfire ambience) to maintain focus and calmness.
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: Fully localized for a global audience (KO/EN).
- **Social Sharing Optimized**: Proper OG/Twitter metadata and cinematic share images.
- **Waitlist & Hub**: Unified lead collection and multi-channel connection (Discord, Instagram, Email).
