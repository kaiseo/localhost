# Our Tech Stack: For Transparent Growth

This website itself is one of the 'digital infrastructures' of the Localhost project.

## Why Next.js and MDX?
We wanted every step of the project to be recorded transparently. MDX is the tool that allows us, as builders, to deliver information most quickly and precisely. Next.js helps us deploy that information most comfortably to the world.

## Building a Village with Code
For us, fixing a single line of code on the website carries the same weight as laying a single brick at our physical base site. This massive project, where the digital and physical worlds are connected, will continue to be disclosed transparently based on the open-source spirit.

We define infrastructure with code and build villages with action.
