# Builder First: The Most Generous Village for Makers

Localhost is designed by 'builders' and operated for builders.

## Creators Must Be Comfortable
Creating something new is a lonely and arduous task. We dream of an environment where infrastructure handles all the chores of life so that builders can fully immerse themselves in creation.

## A Space for Action, Not Proof
We focus on what you are 'building' right now rather than your career or salary. A place where it's okay to fail, but a place where people who keep trying things gather. That's the core of the village we build.

Building a paradise for builders.
