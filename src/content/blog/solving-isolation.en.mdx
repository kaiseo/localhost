# The Shadow of the Digital Nomad: How We Solve Isolation

The truth hidden behind photos of laptops open on stunning beaches is often 'extreme isolation.'

## Belonging Nowhere
Digital nomads are free, but it's hard for them to belong to deep communities. We aim to solve this through an 'infrastructural approach.' It's not just about gathering people; it's about creating a **system** where everyone can inspire each other's work.

## Loose but Solid Solidarity
Localhost aims to be a home-like base that you can return to whenever you want, without being a burden to each other. We aim for a community of colleagues building a village together, not just a hotel where you stay for a night.

We can build further when we are together.
