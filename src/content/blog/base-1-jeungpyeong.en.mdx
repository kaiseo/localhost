# Why we chose Jeungpyeong for Base #1

Hello, this is the **Localhost** Builder Team.

We dream of a massive infrastructure network for nomads worldwide. Many have asked why we chose Jeungpyeong, South Korea, as the starting point, **Base #1**. Today, we’d like to share a bit of that story.

## 1. Disconnecting from the Noise

Seoul is massive and dynamic. But for builders, it sometimes contains too much 'noise.' We wanted an environment where we could focus solely on the code inside the screen and the essence outside the screen.

Jeungpyeong provides the perfect distance. It's a place where the city's noise fades away, replaced by the crackling sound of a campfire.

## 2. Building Physical Infrastructure

We didn't just want to partner with a few cafes. To implement an 'OS' where nomads can actually live and work, we needed a blank canvas. Jeungpyeong was the most flexible and promising location to externalize our vision.

## 3. Future Plans

The Jeungpyeong site will soon be the first deployment site of **'Village OS.'** Systems verified here will be ported to other locals worldwide.

Stay tuned for more updates! 🔥
