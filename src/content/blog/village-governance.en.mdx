# Village Governance: What It Means to Build Together

We aim for a village where members create order themselves, rather than through one-sided control.

## Where Contribution Becomes a Right
Acts of improving village infrastructure or adding positive value to the community become the right to participate in village decision-making. We will manage this process transparently and fairly through technology.

## Our Promise
Instead of complex legal codes, the simple but powerful principle of respecting each other as builders and helping each other grow will lead our village.

Your voice changes the scenery of the village.
