# Future Roadmap: The Journey Toward Base #2

Our journey doesn't end in Jeungpyeong.

## Global Village Network
All systems verified at Base #1 will be modularized and expanded worldwide. We are designing 'Village OS' packages suited for various environments, such as barn-type bases and rooftop office-type bases.

## Suggest Your Local
We accept proposals from builders worldwide. Do you want Localhost's infrastructure to be installed in the local you love? Our network will expand based on user needs.

Let's fill the map together.
