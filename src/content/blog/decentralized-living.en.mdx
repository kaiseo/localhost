# Decentralized Living: Builders Moving Beyond Mega-Cities

Advancements in technology have now given us the right to choose 'where to live.'

## Rediscovering Local
Mega-cities are convenient, but in return, they demand high living costs and constant distraction of attention. Builders are now finding new values in 'local' areas where it is quieter, more focused on the essence, and closer to nature.

## What We Build is the Future Standard
What Localhost is building in Jeungpyeong is not just an alternative space. It's a new form of infrastructure for how future humanity will work and live, and a standard for decentralized living.

Turn off the noise of the city and design your own local space.
