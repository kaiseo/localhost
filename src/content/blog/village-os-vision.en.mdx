# Village OS: Designing an Operating System for Life

**Village OS**, the core product of the **Localhost** project, is more than just a 'collection of buildings.' It is an Operating System (OS) optimized for modern nomads.

## Village as Hardware
Physical spaces—homes, offices, shared kitchens—are like computer memory and CPUs. They must be stable and robust, with guaranteed 'up-time' for users to access at any time. **Base #1**, being prepared in secret, is the first reference model for this hardware.

## Experience as Software
Community activities, deep work sessions, and information sharing are the 'applications' running on top. We program a seamless environment so these apps can run smoothly without any crashes.

## Building for Expansion
Our goal is to deploy this OS to various locals worldwide. We aim for standardized infrastructure so you can feel the same Localhost user experience in Seoul, our hidden forest base, or even Bali or Berlin.

What OS is your life running on?
