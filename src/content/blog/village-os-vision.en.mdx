# Village OS: Designing an Operating System for Life

We don't see a village as just a 'collection of buildings.' For modern nomads, a village must be an **Operating System (OS)**.

## Village as Hardware
Physical spaces—homes, offices, shared kitchens—are like computer memory and CPUs. They must be stable and robust, with guaranteed 'up-time' for users to access at any time. **Base #1** in Jeungpyeong is the first reference model for this hardware.

## Experience as Software
Community activities, deep work sessions, and information sharing are the 'applications' running on top. We program a seamless environment so these apps can run smoothly without any crashes.

## Building for Expansion
Our goal is to deploy this OS to various locals worldwide. We aim for standardized infrastructure so you can feel the same Localhost user experience in Seoul, Jeungpyeong, or even Bali or Berlin.

What OS is your life running on?
