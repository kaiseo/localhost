# Why we chose a Secret Forest for Base #1

Hello, this is the **Localhost** builder team. 

We dream of a massive infrastructure network for nomads worldwide. Many have asked why we chose a confidential deep forest in central Korea as our starting point, **Base #1**. Today, we’d like to share a bit of that story.

## 1. Disconnect Noise

Seoul is massive and dynamic. But for builders, there's often too much 'noise.' We wanted an environment where we could focus solely on the code inside the screen and the essence outside of it. 

This location provides the perfect distance. It’s a mysterious place where the city's noise completely fades away, replaced only by the crackling sound of a campfire.

## 2. Physical Infrastructure

We didn't just want to partner with a few cafes. To implement an 'OS' where nomads can actually live and work, we needed a blank canvas. This quiet forest was the most flexible and promising 'Lab' to externalize our vision.

## 3. Future Plans

This site will soon be the first deployment site of **'Village OS.'** While the exact location remains confidential for now, systems verified here will be ported to other locals worldwide.

Stay tuned for more updates! 🔥
