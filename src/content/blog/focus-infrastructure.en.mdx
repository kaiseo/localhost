# Infrastructure of Focus: Designing Spaces for Hyper-Focus

All spaces in Localhost are designed with the user's 'hyper-focus' as the top priority.

## Blocking Noise, Discovering Essence
Our design principle, 'Amber Glow,' provides visual stability. The appropriate illumination and warm tones, neither too bright nor too dark, help builders minimize eye strain during long working hours and focus solely on their work.

## Intentional Isolation and Connection
24/7 voice channels and physical workspaces maintain an exquisite balance of 'being together but not being disturbed.' This is the core of what we consider true nomad infrastructure.

## Protecting Your Flow
In Localhost, unnecessary notifications or noise that disrupt your flow are minimized. Only the sounds of creation and the crackle of a campfire will stay by your side.

Reconnect with the joy of concentration.
