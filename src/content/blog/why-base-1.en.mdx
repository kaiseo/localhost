# Base #1: Why Jeungpyeong is the Starting Point for Scaling

We want to discuss why the first physical base of Localhost is in Jeungpyeong from a strategic perspective.

## 1. Optimization as a Testbed
While escaping the complexity of a mega-city, physical accessibility—reaching anywhere in the country within 2 hours—was crucial. Jeungpyeong is the most 'standard' local to experiment with and refine our infrastructure system.

## 2. Scalability
We plan to 'clone' the successful model from Jeungpyeong across the country and the world. Every trial and error in Jeungpyeong becomes a solid guideline for future Bases installed globally.

## 3. Meaning Beyond Base #1
The number '#1' promises that '2' and '3' will follow. Jeungpyeong is not just a village; it's the **Genesis Block** of a global nomad network.

Watch how we button up the first step.
